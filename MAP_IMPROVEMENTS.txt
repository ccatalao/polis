Based on your existing map implementation, here are some improvements you could consider for the map section:
User-Specific Filters: Allow users to filter the map by specific attributes. For example, for schools, filter by type (primary, secondary), or for historical sites, filter by era or significance.
Search Functionality: Add a search bar that allows users to find specific locations or features on the map, which would be especially useful when there are many markers.
Custom Map Styles: Offer different base map styles (satellite, terrain, dark mode) to improve visibility depending on the type of data being shown.
Clustering for Dense Areas: Implement marker clustering for areas with many points to improve performance and reduce visual clutter.
Distance Measurement: Add tools to measure distances between points or calculate areas, which could be useful for urban planning scenarios.
User Location: Include a button to center the map on the user's current location to provide context of the data relative to where they are.
Export Options: Allow users to export the visible data as GeoJSON, KML, or even generate a shareable link with the current view.
Additional Metadata Display: Enhance the popup information with images (where available) or add links to related resources.
Feature Comparison: Add functionality to select multiple features and compare their properties side by side.
